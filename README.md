# Stackables

## [Live Site](https://xmoose25x.github.io/Stackables/)

Single Page Application used for visually organizing stackable objects. This helps for neatly organizing your collectables such as [Kawaii Cubes](https://web.archive.org/web/20180319212907/http://kawaiicubes.com/), [Disney's Tsum Tsums](https://characters.disney.com/disney-tsum-tsum), and [Stackable Squad Squishmallows](https://squishmallows.com/stackables-squad/) among many others.
